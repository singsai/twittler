#Bare Minimum Requirements

- [x] Show the user new tweets somehow. (You can show them automatically as they're created, or create a button that displays new tweets.)
- [x] Display the timestamps of when the tweets were created. This timestamp should reflect the actual time the tweets were created, and should not just be hardcoded.
- [x] Design your interface so that you want to look at and use the product you're making.
- [x] Allow the user to click on a username to see that user's timeline.
